The purpose of this student organization is to push our creative skills to the limit and revolutionize the music industry and the way we create music. This club has two main objectives in mind to achieve our purpose:

One part of the club is devoted to invent, fabricate and perform experimental and conventional musical instruments. We intend to design several experimental instruments each term and perform throughout the university as often as possible. This organization will give students a great opportunity to gain valuable experience and integrate multiple and diverse skills such as design, manufacture, music, engineering and more. 

The second objective of this club is to bring students together to play conventional and unconventional musical instruments.  This organization will provide a space for students to make music and enable them to find other musicians with similar interests.  Our yearly goal will be to hold a concert showcasing the instruments we have built as well as the musical talent in our group.
